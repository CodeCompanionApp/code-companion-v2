# Code Companion

Learn to code.

## Development

We're using [https://lernajs.io/](Lerna) to more easily manage this monorepo.

Clone this repository and run `yarn` and then `yarn run bootstrap` to kickstart installation of each package's `node_modules`.

## Packages

For more details, see each package's `README.md`. You'll probably want to start with running the [desktop app](/packages/desktop-app/).
