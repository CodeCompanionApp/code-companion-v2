# Code Companion

## What is Code Companion?

Code Companion is a simple desktop application that teaches you programming and computer skills.

## Application Goals

For the first version of Code Companion we'll focus on having pre-installed lessons.

A user can...

1. View lessons
2. Start a lesson (creates a new lesson workspace, i.e., directory)
3. Continue from an existing workspace
4. Discard lesson workspaces

## How lessons work

- Lessons are plain Markdown formatted files.
- Lesson files are divided into slides
